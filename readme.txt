This is the label distribution database we refered in the paper.
CONF_Data includes the data in CONF corpus, while TW_Data is the Twitter's.
In each subdirectory, it contains three files, all of which are generated by Labeled LDA. 
The "label-index.txt" contains the labels of distributions, and "term-index.txt" is the vacabulary, "topic-term-distributions.csv" contains the distributions.
